# Selkie 

In Celtic mythology, selkies are beings that can transform from seals into humans by shedding their seal skins. They often feature in stories of love and longing, where a selkie's human form is hidden away or discovered by a human.


This library is heavily influenced as a template starter for generative projects. For now it only works with p5. I'll be extending it to also include other templates. 

This is a project to help better understand the process of streamlining my sketches in p5. I've been able to quickly iternate using Processing for years now. But I want to really get a grasp on creating a system that will generate the work that I will be able to use. 

```bash
npm install selkie
```


In order to create a new project, use the following after it has been installed. 
```bash
selkie -t default 
```
